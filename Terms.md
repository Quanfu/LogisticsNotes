# Terms(名词)



### 寄件人(SHIPPER)

**Shipper/Exporter**
>The shipper, or exporter, is the party responsible for packing and preparing all the goods being sent, as well as handling all documents and paperwork needed. These include obtaining the proper licenses and checking for customs exceptions and restrictions to prevent problems during customs clearance both at origin and destination port.


### 收件人(CONSIGNEE)

[CONSIGNMENT / CONSIGNOR / CONSIGNEE](https://logisticsofthings.dhl/story/consignment-consignor-consignee/)

>In a consignment process, it encompasses the sending of goods from a consignor to a consignee. The person who ships the goods is the consignor (exporter), while the receiver is the consignee (importer).


**Consignee**
>The difference between a shipper and a consignee is that the consignee is the receiver of the shipment and is usually the owner of the goods. This may be an individual or a company. Unless otherwise instructed, the party listed as the ‘consignee’ on the Bill of Lading is legally required to be physically present to collect the shipment.

### 通知人(Notify Party)

**Notify Party**

>The notify party is the contact person to be notified when the shipment arrives at destination. This field is usually only required if it’s different from the party listed in the consignee field. The notify party can be the buyer himself, the shipping agent, or any other entity. The notify party is usually also responsible for arranging customs clearance at destination.
